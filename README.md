# PROJECT: CV APPLICATION

This project is my solution for the project that is part of [Odin Project JS Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/). 

## Thank you OP Community

Special thanks to @Alex73, @Kevin and all great people in the community that help us to become better and always got time to help others. 

## Instructions

[x] Create a new project using npx create-react-app cv-project. 
    - This project is using `yarn`. Command  `yarn start` to start the local server on port `localhost:3000`

[x] Remove the boilerplate code created by create-react-app.

[x] Think about how to structure your application into components. Your application should include:

    [x] A section to add general information like name, email, phone number. 

    - General section is conditional rendered in `./src/components/General.js` with conditional rendering for edit and save view.
  
    - Data for general section saves in local state values of first name, last name, phone, email.

    [x] A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study, date of study)

    [x] A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main tasks of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)

    [x] Be sure to include an edit and submit button for each section or for the whole CV, your preference. 

    [x] The submit button should submit your form and display the value of your input fields in HTML elements. 

    [x] The edit button should add back (display) the input fields, with the previously displayed information as values. 

    [x] In those input fields, you should be able to edit and resubmit the content.

[x] Create a components folder in your src directory and add your components.

[x] Include a styles folder in your src directory for your CSS files. You’ll need to import these in the component files to use them.

[ ] Don’t forget to push your solution to GitHub. You should be proud of your work and show it off to the world!
